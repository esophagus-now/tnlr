Make sure the automatic webview is disabled. (Finally!
There used to be now way to disable this and it was
really difficult to do any coding that had sockets...)

To run a basic test, here is what I do:

1. Start the echo server (on port 2323) with:
   $ python echo.py

2. Start a "server" with:
   $ ncat -l -p 3000 -k -m 1 -v

3. Start tnlr, and its lua CLI, type:
   tc = connect("127.0.0.1", 2323)
   tn = tc:tunnel(2000, "127.0.0.1", 3000)

4. Connect to the new tunnel with:
   $ ncat localhost 2000

Now any traffic between the two ncat instances will be
tunneled by tnlr!
